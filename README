An R script that generates an interactive plot of the last 5 days before (possibly several)
conference submission deadlines (including some ugly system magic that only works on Unix),
allowing you to compare last day submission behavior across venues, and infer how many submissions
you can expect this year. This might be helpful to, e.g. early on increase the number of your
reviewers.

It expects the raw input to be in the form of `<venue>-arrivals.csv`. Every venue should have
its own file. This file should contain a parseable version of the submission time, like

```
"Dec 14, 13:30"
"Jan 15, 22:16"
```
